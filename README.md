# BurgerMaker
UTAUS201902FSF3-FT/01-class-content/14-handlebars/02-Homework/

In this assignment, we went deep into the Model-View-Controller paradigm PLUS server-side templating for the frontend PLUS a new approach to the database via ORM and Sequelize. We created a
burger maker where the user can "devour" an avaiable burger, see the burger go from available to devoured, and add their own burgers as well. There were numerous challenges to this assignment,
notably getting the different pieces to communicate properly with each other (controllers, db, models, handlebars views files, etc).
